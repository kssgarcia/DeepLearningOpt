[SIMP_multi.py](https://github.com/kssgarcia/DeepLearningOpt/blob/main/simp/SIMP_multi.py) code used for generate training dataset.

[CNN.py](https://github.com/kssgarcia/DeepLearningOpt/blob/main/neural_network/CNN.py) code used for training neural network.

[load_model.py](https://github.com/kssgarcia/DeepLearningOpt/blob/main/neural_network/CNN2.py) code used for load neural network.

[SIMP_multi_dist.py](https://github.com/kssgarcia/DeepLearningOpt/blob/main/neural_network/SIMP_multi_dist.py) code used for generate dataset with a distributed load.

### Results folders

- `results_1f` Folder with the data with just 1 force
- `results_2f` Folder with the data with just 2 force is divided in third parts, this contain the first part with the first columns.
- `results_2f_2` Folder with the data with just 2 force second part
- `results_2f_3` Folder with the data with just 2 force third part
- `results_merge_#` Folder with the data mix of all folders
